# Elm *State Machine* Tutorial

My work from this nice tutorial by dnimmo: https://dev.to/clicktravelengorg/the-basic-elm-example-that-i-wish-id-had-40m8. 

It helps you reason about development via first focusing on the model(s) and state(s) of your program, while also introducing you to Elm (as this line of reasoning is inherint in its design).
